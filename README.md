How small a square can contain `n` unit squares? Write `s(n)` for its minimum
side length. Squares may rotate; their interiors cannot overlap.

[![Packing results for 1–100 squares. Green marks proved optima; white marks bounds only. Click to explore.](docs/assets/coverage.svg)](https://chelokot.github.io/square-packing-archive/#explore)

**Every result has a kernel-checked Lean proof.** Green cells mark proved optima;
white cells mark bounds only. Select a count to inspect the packing, coordinates,
authors, sources, and proof.

### Nagamochi’s lemma and a replacement proof

The archive contains a [Lean-checked counterexample to Lemma 1](docs/nagamochi-score-counterexample.md)
in Nagamochi’s 2005 paper. **It contradicts the individual-square score lemma,
not the packing theorem.** A [replacement argument](docs/nagamochi-compensation-proof.md)
proves `s(n²−2) = n` without assuming that lemma. It covers square containers,
not the paper’s full rectangular-container theorem.

## What is checked

Every catalogued claim, including historical entries, is checked against a Lean
theorem with the stated square count, relation, and exact formal value. The
dependency audit permits only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`;
it rejects unfinished proofs, custom axioms, and native-evaluation oracles.
See the [data model](docs/data-model.md) for provenance and display conventions.

An upper bound proves that a packing exists, not that it is optimal or best known.
The historical catalog is incomplete. Counts without a catalogued record use
the basic grid bound `s(n) ≤ ⌈√n⌉`; these do not count as historical records.
Publication dates and formalization dates are kept separate.

## Run and verify

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/), Python 3, and [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).
The Bun dependencies, Lean toolchain, and Mathlib revision are pinned.

```console
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

To check the site, archive, and proofs from the repository root:

```console
bun run build
bun run check
bun run test
(cd formal && lake exe cache get && lake --wfail build)
```

See the [development guide](docs/development.md) for architecture, imports,
additional tests, and deployment. GitHub Pages updates only after CI passes.

## Contribute

- **A result with a Lean proof:** open a pull request following [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **A result awaiting formalization:** open an [issue](https://github.com/chelokot/square-packing-archive/issues), with sources, coordinates, and attribution.
- Corrections, historical sources, and viewer improvements are welcome too.

For example, the stronger reported 11-square bound is tracked in [issue #16](https://github.com/chelokot/square-packing-archive/issues/16);
the public construction currently proves only `s(11) ≤ 3.88`.
